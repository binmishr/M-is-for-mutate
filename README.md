A Brief Introduction
=====================
Today, we finally talk about the mutate function! I’ve used it a lot throughout the series so far, so it’s nice to get to discuss what it is and how it works.

The mutate function is used anytime you want create or modify a variable. It works with pretty much any R function that creates/modifies variables, so you can wrap it around code to create factors, base R code for descriptive statistics (like median, mean, standard deviation), convert a character to a number (or vice versa), compute a date difference, and so on, as well as use any arithmetic or logical operations. You can include multiple new and/or modified variables in your mutate function, and even create or change variables using ones you created in the same mutate command.
